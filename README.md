# Postal Puzzle

## Application Summary
An application that tests the user's knowledge of NPM (Node Package Manager) via a quiz game.

## Development:
Development was conducted around the premise of having as little in state than what needed to live there (dynamic values and/or user-interaction based values.)
Localstorage was implemented but later removed, with plans to re-introduce it after a refactor of the App componenent. One of the first goals is to remove the dataset from App state.
The next future development goal is to re-implement the components that were removed during the refactor phase.
